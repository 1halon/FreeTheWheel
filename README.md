OS X Catalina
============

This is a fork of [jackhumbert's FreeTheWheel](https://github.com/jackhumbert/FreeTheWheel).
I just made it to work on OS X Catalina. As far is I know, it works for the following wheels. Please let me know if your wheel works!

* G27
* Driving Force GT

Free The Wheel for OS X
============

Logitech driving wheel enabler based on [Feral Interactive's FreeTheWheel](http://support.feralinteractive.com/en/faqs/free_the_wheel/)

## Features for the G27

* Full 900Ëš Rotation
* Force Feedback with the [LogitechForceFeedback.kext](http://faq.iracing.com/article.php?id=209)
* 3 Buttons enabled on the wheel
* More?

## What it's missing

* Clutch support
* All 6 buttons on the wheel
* Shifter support?

## How to use it

Run `./FreeTheWheel` (or double-click it) once you've plugged in your wheel. You'll need to run it every time you restart/plug it in.

## How to compile

Assuming you have a development environment, run `make`
